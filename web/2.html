  <h2>Machine Learning이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p style="margin-top:80px;"><strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/textlevel-semantics.html#the-a-element" target="
    blank" title="html5">Machine learning (ML)</a></strong> is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.[1] It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.[2] Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.<br>
  <img src="machine_learning.jpg", width="100%">A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.[4][5] In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.</p>
